# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
	
	Our friend Louise has an idea for a play which is generating some interest. Louise estimates the play, 'Fever', will have a budget of over $10,000, which she would like to raise with a Kickstarter campaign. As this will be her first experience with fundraising, she as asked that we take data of previous fundraisers, and turn it into a meaningful plan for her own. 

### Purpose
	
	We have decided to narrow the focus of our analysis to the timing of the launch of past fundraisers, and to the goals of past fundraisers. Louise would like a deeper understanding of a correlation between successful fundraising campaigns, the months they were launched, and their goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

	How have the success of fundraisers been affected by the time of year in which they were launched? Could the goals we set affect the results of fundraisers we wouldn't expect? If they do, how substantial is the effect of the timing and initial goal? We may make assumptions about these factors, but without data, we could be wildly off. Without effective visualizations the data we find, people like Louise may not heed our findings either. We need to present our findings in a way that is accessible and meaningful.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	
	The data seems rather clear that the month in which a fundraiser is launched is an important factor in its success. In general, fundraisers tend to do much better late spring to early summer than late fall to early winter. May has a history of particularly successful fundraisers, which gradually decline until bottoming out in December. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

	It is tempting to suggest that particular fundraising goals have better success rates than others, but our data for goals seems less clear than our data for the timing of fundraisers. Projects with goals under $14,000 tend to have a higher percentage of success, the inverse is true from $15,000 to approx $35,000, then we see a dramatic decline in success of fundraisers attempting to collect more than $40,000. Modest goals seem to have fairly reliable rates of success. Lofty goals are more certainly unrealistic.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

	We strongly suggest kicking off fundraisers in late spring, as close to May as possible. Conversely, is this timeframe is not feasible, we strongly suggest avoiding kicking off fundraisers in fall or winter. We would go so far as to recommend long-term planning take substantial effort to avoid kicking off the fundraiser between September through March.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

	Our data regarding goals is somewhat less conclusive than launch date data. We can be certain to say that productions costing more than $40,000 should find support outside Kickstarter fundraisers. For those kinds of productions, we would suggest seeking out individual patrons of substantial means. Kickstarter has a high success rate for projects with nominal goals, but once those goals approach $15,000, we would suggest finding other sources of funding.	

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

	We feel there is a rather quixotic fluctuation in outcomes based on goals. We would likely benefit from more data about why we see a decline in success from nominal goals to the $20,000 mark, then gains and a plateau till the $35,000 range, then a dramatic decline.
	In hindsight, we may have missed some factors that could greatly affect the outcome of a fundraiser. Most importantly, what kind of events have been held to support the fundraiser? Have previous fundraisers been supported by a gala or party of some kind? Have the actors been selected while the fundraisers were ongoing, and recruited to draw attention to the fundraisers? Is there a budget factored into events supporting a fundraiser. This kind of data could be very helpful to mold our fundraisers in the future.


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	
	If we had the data, our findings would most certainly be augmented with tables and graphs that illustrate details of past fundraisers. It would be helpful to know how much money has been spent on fundraising events, and at what point does that money spent bring no further return. We may also find interest in the correlation between goals, actual production costs, and the success of the fundraisers.
